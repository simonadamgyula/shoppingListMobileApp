:--------------------------:|:--------:

A flutter (mobile) app that helps you keep track of shopping list.

## Install

1. You need to run the api yourself, because I couldn't deploy the api anywhere yet. So download the [Api](https://github.com/simonadamgyula/shoppingListApi).
2. In the file ``` lib/http_request.dart ``` change ``` apiUrl ``` to your api url.
3. Build the app using ``` flutter build apk ``` and install the apk on your android phone.
4. Great job, you can now user the app.
